merge sort
+------------------------------+----------+
| Worst Case time complexity   | O(nlogn) |
| Best Case time complexity    | O(nlogn) |
| Average case time complexity | O(nlogn) |
| Space Complexity             | O(n)     |
| Stable Sorting               | Yes      |

Additional Information:
In Microsoft Excel, Press File->Save as -> .csv
There is no need for a multiple TextToCSV converter it can be done in under a minute by dragging and dropping in Excel.

Future Direction:
Package can be imported for Entropy calculation:
S = k ln (W)
S: Entropy of the system
k: Boltzmann's constant
ln W: Natural logarithm of the number of microstates
